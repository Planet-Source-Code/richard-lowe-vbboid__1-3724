## vbBoid


</div>

### Description

This program uses three simple rules for each BOID, which when applied in the correct proportion produce emergent flocking behaviour. This program is entirely based on the work of Craig Reynolds (http://htm.com/cwr/boid.htm). I developed this program after a debate with a c++ programmer, who said that VB wasn't up to the job. See what you think.
